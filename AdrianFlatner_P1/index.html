                    <h3>CSS-grid:</h3>
                    <p>I have used CSS-grid to structure my website. The reason for not using Flexbox is the
                        possibility to
                        structure over columns in CSS-grid. The website has a grid to structure the different sections.
                        Inside section two there exists a new grid to split the animations. It is possible to only use
                        one
                        grid
                        for the whole page, but this structure is used for learning purposes and more control over each
                        section.</p>
                    <h3>Canvas:</h3>
                    <p>The canvas is made using JavaScript to keep the code on the same document. I chose to
                        make a
                        frame to make the reader interact. When the reader does a mouseover,
                        the
                        code executes. The animation is made using circles which changes position,
                        and through easy manipulation and loops seems like lines crashing in the canvas walls. If the
                        reader does multiple mouseovers the lines speed up, and the reader can slow down the random
                        masterpiece by clicking on the canvas. Both animations uses some code from the tutorial listed
                        in sources. This applies only to the functions to get circles to crash the walls. </p>
                    <h3>SVG:</h3>
                    <p>The SVG is made in a similar way to the canvas. Key differences are how the shapes are made. It's
                        no
                        longer strokes, and are now directly added to the frame. Here too I decided to not clear the
                        image when the balls move. This makes the picture seem like a
                        neverending
                        canvas for art. What I never anticipated was that with neverending SVG(neverending vectors) the
                        animation of course started to lag. I decided to let it be, to show the key differences in
                        animation for svg versus canvas. As with the canvas, the reader can slow down the animation by
                        mouse click. To make the programming of the frame simpler, the shapes for the frame is directly
                        added in the index.html document.</p>
                    <h3>jQuery:</h3>
                    <p>The fast jQuery JavaScript library is used in all JavaScript files. This applies when doing
                        DOM-manipulation, event handling and animation
                        in the documents. This means for instance when I
                        otherwise would use "document.getElementById", or when css has to be changed and similar.</p>
                    <h3>Cross-browser testing:</h3>
                    <p>The website is testet in Chrome, Safari and Edge. The same behavior is observed on all the
                        mentioned browsers.</p>
